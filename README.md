# Lucid Raycaster

A simple raycasting engine that I originally wrote back in college (2017) and recently decided to rewrite in Rust for no
particular reason. The original version was written in Java, but let's be honest for a bit and admit that 
absolutely no one likes Java. Perhaps not even Java developers themselves. So here we are.

## What's New?

The Rust rewrite adds some new features to the original:
- Proper movement and collision detection (We're big boys now)
- Enemy AI with patrol paths and combat behavior
- Projectile system with particle effects
- TOML-based map format for easy modding

## Building & Running

### Clone the repo

### Build it
```bash
cargo build --release
```
### Run it
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Controls
- WASD: Move around
- Mouse: Look around
- Left Click: Shoot
- Escape: Toggle mouse capture

## "But what's the purpose of this project?"

If you're asking that question, you're clearly thinking too hard about it.
1. It's fun
2. Rust
3. See points 1 and 2

## Future Plans

Will I work on this more? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I’ll wake up in a cold sweat at 3 AM with the sudden realization that I must implement dynamic lighting. Maybe I’ll forget this exists entirely and move on with my life like a well-adjusted person. Only time will tell.

## License

Do whatever you want with it.
If you somehow find a use for this, you're probably a genius or insane.

Either way, I respect that. Or I pity you. Or maybe I fear you. I don’t know. I don’t care.

In fact, I refuse to acknowledge any consequences of this project’s existence. If this code is somehow responsible for thermonuclear war, interdimensional instability, or the heat death of the universe, that's on you. I take no responsibility. You looked at the repo. You made choices. Now you must live with them. Or don’t. Whatever.
